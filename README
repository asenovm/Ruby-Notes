<center><h2>About</h2></center>
Ruby notes is a console based system that let you make notes about important things, set a period during which the note is valid, list the notes you've made in various ways and based on various search patterns. It also allows you to link each of the notes to a specific (list of) tag/s and later on perform searches based on these tags.
